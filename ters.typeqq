_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function is to calculate the MuSiC deconvolution proportions
     with clusters

     music_prop.cluster(bulk.eset, sc.eset, group.markers, groups, clusters,
       samples, clusters.type, verbose = TRUE, iter.max = 1000,
       nu = 1e-04, eps = 0.01, centered = FALSE, normalize = FALSE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

bulk.eset: ExpressionSet for bulk data

 sc.eset: ExpressionSet for single cell data

group.markers: list of gene names. The list include differential
          expressed genes within groups.  List name must be the same as
          `clusters.type`.

  groups: character, the phenoData of single cell data used as groups;

clusters: character, the phenoData of single cell dataset used as
          clusters;

 samples: character,the phenoData of single cell dataset used as
          samples;

clusters.type: list of cell types. The list identify groups of similar
          cell types.

 verbose: logical, default as TRUE.

iter.max: numeric, maximum iteration number

      nu: regulation parameter, take care of weight when taking
          recipical

     eps: Thredshold of convergence

centered: logic, substract avg of Y and D

normalize: logic, divide Y and D by their standard deviation

_V_a_l_u_e:

     matrix of estimated proportions by MuSiC with cluster information.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     ‘music_basis’; ‘music_prop’
